        "line1": "Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by tattoos. I'd cover myself with temporary tattoo stickers and draw designs directly on my skin with pens. This childhood hobby sparked my lifelong passion for art. I slowly started my journey in 2018, when I first picked up a needle and experimented with the stick & poke technique on myself.",
        "line2": "After graduating with a degree in Fine Art from Bristol University in England, I moved to Denmark. Here, I continue my journey into the world of art and tattooing. My work is characterized by its delicate and elegant style. I strive to create tattoos that are not only visually captivating but also deeply meaningful for each individual."
